# GitHub Copilot Instructions

Welcome to the `csla-mcp` repository! To ensure Copilot provides relevant and high-quality suggestions, please follow these guidelines:

## Coding Style
- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- Prefer explicit variable names.
- Follow C# conventions for naming and structure.

## Documentation
- Add XML comments to public classes and methods.
- Use summary tags for method descriptions.

## Best Practices
- Write clean, maintainable code.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration where possible.
- Implement error handling and logging.

## Pull Requests
- Ensure code is tested before submitting.
- Include a clear description of changes.

## Copilot Usage
- Use Copilot to generate boilerplate, tests, and documentation.
- Review and edit Copilot suggestions for accuracy and security.

## Change logs and change documents
- Create all change logs and change documents in the `changelogs` folder.
- When documenting fixes or other changes, put the documents in the `changelogs` folder.

## Markdown Files
- Do NOT wrap markdown file content with ````markdown and ```` delimiters at the top and bottom.
- Markdown files should contain plain markdown content so they render correctly on GitHub and other platforms.
- Code blocks within markdown files should use the appropriate language fence (e.g., ```csharp), but the file itself should not be wrapped.
