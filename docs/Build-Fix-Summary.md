# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Version Mismatch
- **Problem**: `ModelContextProtocol` package version 1.0.0 didn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated to available version `0.3.0-preview.4`

### 2. Compilation Errors in Code Examples
- **Problem**: Code example files (.cs) in `CodeExamples/` folder were being compiled as part of the project
- **Solution**: Added `<Compile Remove="CodeExamples\**\*" />` to exclude them from compilation while keeping them as content

### 3. Razor File Processing
- **Problem**: Blazor `.razor` file was being processed and causing compilation errors
- **Solution**: Renamed from `.razor` to `.razor.txt` to treat it as content only

### 4. Missing Swagger Dependencies
- **Problem**: `UseSwagger()` and `UseSwaggerGen()` methods not available
- **Solution**: Added `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` and `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` packages

### 5. Array Type Inference Issue
- **Problem**: Compiler couldn't infer type for enum arrays in JSON schema definitions
- **Solution**: Explicitly declared `object[]` for tools array and removed problematic enum arrays

### 6. Test Accessibility Issue
- **Problem**: `Program` class was not accessible to integration tests
- **Solution**: Added `public partial class Program { }` to make it accessible for testing

### 7. JSON Response Structure Mismatch
- **Problem**: Tests expected direct response properties but server returns JSON-RPC wrapped responses
- **Solution**: Updated tests to access `result` property in JSON-RPC response structure

### 8. Test Warning Fixes
- **Problem**: xUnit analyzer warnings about test patterns
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed `Assert.True()` to `Assert.Contains()` for collection checks
  - Made test cleanup method `private` instead of `public`

## Result
- ? **Clean Build**: All projects compile successfully
- ? **All Tests Pass**: 12/12 tests passing
- ? **No Warnings**: Clean build with no compilation warnings
- ? **Functional Server**: MCP server starts and responds correctly to requests
